<!--Genereal information to be displayed on webpage-->
			<p class= "intro">Nintendo. The name synonymous with most people's childhood, and the childhood of their children. 
			A company well-known for only being a video game company, most famous for the Mario and Zelda series during the mid-1980s to present day. 
			The Big-N, as some of their fans call them. Nintendo by how I just described them may sound like a really young company that was only founded 30 years ago, but that is quite the opposite.</p>
			
			<p class= "intro">Nintendo as a company, was founded over 100 years ago (recently celebrating their 130th birthday), located in Kyoto, Japan. 
			Though it is not truly known, it is believed that the meaning of the company's name is to, "leave luck to heaven".
			Their original business was in making a well-known Japanese playing card deck called, Hanafuda. 
			The name of these playing cards when translated from Japanese to English means, "flower cards". 
			These were similar to the ones used still in North America, and had many different uses and games. 
			Over time, Nintendo as a company had started to change and so did its philosophies too.
			During this time, they had started to venture into many different industries to find what was profitable for them, until eventually, they had started developing electronic games.</p>
